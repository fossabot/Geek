[iA-Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) is a Markdown editor for MacOS and iOS which lets the user control the rendering through templates and anybody can create his own template, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates). This repository features such a template, named Geek providing:

- mathematics through Mathjax,
- source code highlighting through Prism.

All necessary Javascript is locally installed, so that the templates can be used offline.
